# Got product ideas?

Find out if they're any good with rapid, validated learning.

Assemble your idea, your customers, your product and your team in weeks, not months.

## Make useful prototypes

Ideas need to get off paper an into the real world, asap. We help you create bare bones, functional prototypes (often in a matter of hours) to better understand the problem you think you're solving, identify the assumptions you're sub-consciously making, prioritize your endless set of features and make clear what needs to happen next.

## Prove it's a good idea

You need more than your polite friends' opinions. We help you get real data, and sometimes real customers who are willing to pay to use your product idea. Most importantly, we help you prove to yourself that it's worth giving up your time, energy and money to pursue this idea further.
